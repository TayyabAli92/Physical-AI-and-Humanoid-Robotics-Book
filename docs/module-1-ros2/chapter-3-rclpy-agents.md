# RCLPY Agents: Programming with ROS 2 in Python

This chapter guides you through programming ROS 2 applications using `rclpy`, the Python client library for ROS 2.
We will explore how to create ROS 2 nodes, publish messages, subscribe to topics, and implement services and actions using Python.
This is a practical guide for developing humanoid robot behaviors.

- Setting up a Python environment for ROS 2
- Creating `rclpy` nodes
- Implementing publishers, subscribers, clients, and servers
