# URDF for Humanoids: Robot Description Format

This chapter introduces the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF), a crucial XML format for describing robot kinematics, dynamics, and visual properties.
We will focus on applying URDF to model humanoid robots, enabling their simulation and control within the ROS 2 ecosystem.
This knowledge is foundational for creating accurate digital twins of physical robots.

- Introduction to URDF syntax and structure
- Defining links and joints for humanoid robots
- Adding visual and collision properties
- Integrating URDF models with ROS 2 and Gazebo
