# AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation using Docusaurus and GitHub Pages Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy
All technical explanations about Docusaurus, GitHub Pages, Spec-Kit Plus, and Claude Code must be factually correct and verifiable.

### Clarity
Write in simple, structured language suitable for beginner-to-intermediate developers learning documentation systems.

### Consistency
Maintain a unified style, tone, and structure across all chapters.

### Modular Writing
Each chapter must be spec-driven, self-contained, and able to be independently validated.

### Reproducibility
Every workflow, command, or configuration must be replicable by following the book.

### Transparency
Clearly distinguish between official documentation, community knowledge, and original interpretations.

## Key Standards

- All instructions, code snippets, commands, and configurations must be tested or validated through primary sources (official docs or working examples).
- Citation format: Link-based referencing (official docs, GitHub repos, blog posts).
- Source types: 60% must come from primary sources such as official documentation or published guides.
- Plagiarism check: Zero tolerance. Writing must be original and rewritten in the book’s voice.
- Writing clarity: Flesch-Kincaid grade level 8-10 (easy to follow for developers).

## Content Requirements

- Book must provide a complete journey from setup → authoring → publishing a book using: Docusaurus, GitHub Pages, Spec-Kit Plus, Claude Code.
- Each chapter must follow Spec-Kit Plus spec-driven structure.
- Include diagrams, code blocks, and step-by-step guides when needed.

## Constraints

- Length: Full book should be 20,000–35,000 words (minimum).
- Formats:
  - Source written in Markdown (Docusaurus-compatible)
  - Final deployment to GitHub Pages
- Include at least 15–20 technical references to official documentation.

## Success Criteria

- Entire book can be executed end-to-end by a new user with successful deployment to GitHub Pages.
- All steps, commands, and workflows verified through testing.
- Clear learning outcomes at the end of each chapter.
- Zero factual errors detected in cross-checking with primary sources.
- All writing aligned with the constitution and Spec-Kit Plus methodology.

## Governance

Any changes to this constitution must be proposed via a Pull Request, reviewed by core contributors, and approved by the project lead. Significant changes require consensus from at least two core contributors. This constitution follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). The constitution's adherence is reviewed quarterly by the project lead.
