# Contracts

This directory would typically contain API contracts (e.g., OpenAPI schemas) for software projects. However, for the "AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation using Docusaurus + GitHub Pages" project, there are no traditional APIs being developed. The "contracts" for this project are primarily the specifications, plans, and content structures defined in the Markdown files themselves.
