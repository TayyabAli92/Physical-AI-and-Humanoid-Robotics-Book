# Specification Quality Checklist: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-06
**Feature**: [specs/001-physical-ai-robotics-book/spec.md](specs/001-physical-ai-robotics-book/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The `TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE)` placeholder in `.specify/memory/constitution.md` is still unresolved and was flagged by `/sp.analyze`. This is outside the scope of `spec.md` but should be addressed.
